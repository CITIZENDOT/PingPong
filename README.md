### Inspiration

This project is inspired by [this](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrjEQvEart7faAurUFBS0zHyxktPUuyEI) playlist. Also, I improved somethings over that.

- Game doesn't glitch. It super smooth now.
- Emojis & Better looking UI.
- Proper Classes which inherit from each other so, less repeated code.
- Last but not least, CROSS PLATFORM!
